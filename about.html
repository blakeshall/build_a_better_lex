    <h4>About</h4>

    <p>
      I'm Blake Hall and I'm a concerned urbanist in Lexington, KY.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lexington, like most American cities, is overly car-dependent and the majority of
      the city is unsafe for pedestrians and cyclists alike. Here I plan on pointing out
      problems that exist throughout the city, critique proposed developments, and offer
      some potential solutions to make Lexington more livable for all.
