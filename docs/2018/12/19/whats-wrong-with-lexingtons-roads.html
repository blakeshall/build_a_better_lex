    <p>2018 has been the deadliest year for Lexington pedestrians since the city
started tracking in 1996. 14 Lexingtonians have been killed by cars while
walking. Unfortunately, the <a href="https://www.facebook.com/LexKyPolice/videos/632514183829893">police</a>
and local news stations have approached this
with the usual narrative: victim blaming. The city’s own traffic data page that
has a section specifically for Pedestrian fatalities lists “Dark clothing / not
visible” as “collision factors” for 4 of the incidents, which, last I checked,
was not illegal. So obviously to alleviate future incidents we should
immediately have council institute a city wide dress code for anyone on a
sidewalk. Preferably, they should be required to wear a hi-vis vest as to give
drivers the utmost consideration.</p>

<p>Sadly, many people will not see my sarcasm until the hi-vis vest part. For many
people who have grown up around car dependence, when looking at any one instance
of a pedestrian collision, they go the easy route and say something like “they
weren’t at a crosswalk”, which often ignores a lot of context. There are
numerous reasons that someone crosses outside a crosswalk. Maybe they’re old,
it’s over 1000ft to the nearest crosswalk, and it’s cold out. Or the bus drops
them off and their job is about to start on the other side of the street.
Regardless, jaywalking should not be a death sentence.</p>

<p>When I defend pedestrians, many will assume I’m trying to assign blame to the
drivers, which isn’t the case. Sometimes the pedestrian darts out without
looking. Sometimes the driver is speeding. But most of the time the road and
environment are designed in such a way that almost ensures that a collision
will happen eventually, usually because it gives hardly any concern to
pedestrians. Here are some anecdotal examples of poorly designed local streets
that are either unsafe for pedestrians or encourage unsafe behaviors:</p>

<h4 class="post-sub-header p-2">Walking Richmond Rd.</h4>

<p>I live in Kenwick, on Richmond Ave, and one of the local amenities that we and
our neighbors enjoy is Ashland, the Henry Clay estate, with its 
grounds that many use for walking and jogging. Now, according to Google, it’s
about 1100ft from the corner of Richmond Ave. and Richmond Rd to Ashland 
(the estate). Problem is, there aren’t any crosswalks across Richmond Rd 
for that entire stretch, even though multiple streets connect to it. So what’s
a law-abiding pedestrian to do? Cross at a crosswalk of course! And the nearest
crosswalk is about… 1185ft away… in the opposite direction. So to legally
get to Ashland (the estate) from Richmond Ave I would have to walk north all the
way to Ashland Ave, cross Richmond Rd, then walk 2275ft back south. That’s over
TRIPLE the distance I would have to walk if I just jaywalked. Is it any wonder
that I see so many people jaywalking on a regular basis?</p>

<h4 class="post-sub-header p-2">Main to Midland</h4>

<p>The intersection of Main and Midland (and Vine) is often regarded as the
beginning of downtown. Which makes its current state even more of a travesty.
The intersection is a prime example of putting cars’ convenience over even the
most basic pedestrian considerations. The problem lies with it’s right turn 
lanes (and left from Vine to Main). They are what’s called ‘slip lanes’ and you
can see one of them in the Streetview below.</p>

<p><img src="/build_a_better_lex/assets/img/main-and-midland.png" alt="Main and Midland" /></p>

<p>Slip lanes are, according to Wikipedia, “a road traffic lane provided at an
intersection to allow vehicles to turn at the intersection without actually
entering it and interfering with through traffic. It is therefore not controlled
by any traffic signals at that intersection.” So it makes turning easier and
avoids the main intersection, thereby make traffic flow smoother. Well,
vehicular traffic.</p>

<p>The problem is that last section about no traffic signals. What that translates
into is that pedestrians have to wait for an empty street or a generous driver
who actually yields. It’s a particular problem on Vine St side as, due to Vine
St’s width, it encourages speeding, so drivers rarely have much time to look for
a pedestrian because the intersection comes right after a curve. Personally,
I’ve stood on the corner and watched 4 to 5 cars blow by me without the least
consideration.</p>

<p>The intersection also suffers from a problem that most of our downtown streets
suffer from:</p>

<h4 class="post-sub-header p-2">One way streets</h4>

<p>One way streets are terrible in numerous ways, but are particularly bad for
pedestrians. One way, multi lane streets encourage speeding as Jeff Speck lists
in his book “Walkable City Rules”; “First, due to that lowered risk of head-on
collisions. Second, because a street with many lanes in the same direction just
feels like a highway. Third, because a choice of lanes provides the opportunity
to jockey.”</p>

<p>Other than speeding, another problem with one way streets is one I’ve
personally experienced; drivers looking only at oncoming traffic when turning.
Since traffic only comes one way, drivers often only pay attention to where the
traffic is coming from and not to pedestrians who may be coming from the
opposite direction. I even had to slap the hood of one lady’s car because she
was rolling into the crosswalk to turn while looking the other way.</p>

<h4 class="post-sub-header p-2">Don't jump to blame the pedestrian</h4>

<p>Any one of these issues can be brushed aside with a simple “Follow traffic
laws”. Pedestrians should cross at crosswalks, regardless of how inconvenient or
incredibly out of the way they are. Drivers should yield to pedestrians, even in
slip lanes, and drivers should always look both ways before turning out onto the
street. The problem with those simple responses is that they try to bend people
to follow the environment rather than have the environment built around how
people behave. People will want to cross the road more frequently than every
1000ft. Drivers will continue to follow the flow of traffic even if a pedestrian
is waiting to cross and drivers will pay more attention to big metal boxes
coming towards them than the one or two people slowly coming the other way.</p>

<p>So next time you see in the news that a pedestrian was hit by a car, before
writing it off with a “They should have been in a crosswalk”, take a moment and
“zoom out” and look where they were hit. Was the crosswalk really far away? Is
the road poorly lit and designed for cars to move fast? How long does it take
for the signal to cycle? And, most importantly, ask yourself if we could do
better.</p>
