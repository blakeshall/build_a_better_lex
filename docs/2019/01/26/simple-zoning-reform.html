    <p>One thing I try to explain to people is how there can be little poison pills in
our zoning ordinance that can hamper good incremental development and enforce 
the dichotomy of single use buildings or massive multiuse buildings. A good 
example of this is Lexington’s <strong>P-1 Professional Office</strong> zone. The name is self
explanatory, but this zone is meant for general offices like banks, medical
offices, and pretty much any sort of desk job, but it also includes day cars and
barber shops. It even allows residential which seems like it would work out as a
nice mixed use zone. But there is one small condition on dwelling units that
kills small projects and essentially guarantees that any development in a P-1
zone will be small offices or large apartment buildings with offices on the
ground floor. Here’s the text in question under Permitted Uses:</p>

<div class="card w-50 mx-auto mb-4 p-auto">
  <p class="card-body text-muted">
    Dwelling units, provided the units are not
    located on the first floor of a structure and
    provided that at least the first floor is occupied
    by another permitted use or uses in the P-1
    zone, with no mixing of other permitted uses
    and dwelling units on any floor.
  </p>
</div>

<p>At first glance it seems rather innocuous, but let’s use an example of an
existing building on Walton, which is not zoned P-1 but right next to a strip of
properties that is zoned P-1.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/107walton.png" alt="107 Walton" /></p>

<p>As it stands now, if you had a property zoned P-1, it would be essentially
impossible to build this building if you wanted offices on the ground floor
and an apartment or two above.</p>

<h4 id="whats-the-problem">What’s the problem?</h4>

<p>It appears to meet the zoning codes, so what’s the hold up? The problem comes
with ADA compliance and financing. Newly constructed multifamily buildings must
comply with the ADA, specifically all “public” areas, which in our case would be
a shared entrance. For a building to be considered “accessible” under ADA, 100%
of it’s ground floor units must be accessible. If there are no
residential units on the ground floor, the lowest floor with residential units
is considered the ground floor for the purposes of accessibility. So this means
that in our example above the second floor needs to be 100% accessible. Which
means an elevator. Which means it won’t pencil out. No one can justify an
elevator for a two story building with all of 2 apartments at most.</p>

<h4 id="why-not-just-build-a-bigger-building">Why not just build a bigger building?</h4>

<p>So if a small building doesn’t make financial sense, why not a big one? Let’s
look at some of the areas around downtown that are zoned P-1.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/p-1-downtown.png" alt="P-1 Downtown" /></p>

<p>You can see on Walton the strip of P-1 properties next to our earlier example.
This is right between the Bell Court neighborhood and the Ashland/Mentelle
neighborhoods. There is absolutely no way those neighborhoods will allow
anything over 2-3 stories to be built without a substantial fight and
substantial cost in time and money. Same goes for the cluster of P-1s near
Woodland Triangle and at Main and Kentucky. Personally, I understand that, it
would be a drastic change to the existing streetscape to build anything higher
(except maybe near the Woodland Triangle), and overall goes against my desire
for incremental development and gentle density.</p>

<p>So what’s a property owner/developer to do if they want to redevelop the
property? As it stands now, they would either have to build a one story, single
use office building or fight and push through a multistory building that would
have to be large enough to justify the cost of the elevator(s) and the cost
of fighting the neighborhood. More often than not it will be the former just
because it’s simpler. But it doesn’t do anything to increase density or help in
dealing with our housing shortage.</p>

<h4 id="what-would-i-like-to-see-done">What would I like to see done?</h4>

<p>I believe this can be fixed in a simple way that has been used by other cities
and small developers; Allow residential units on the ground floor to mix with 
the office space. Here is one example, touted by the 
<a href="https://www.incrementaldevelopment.org/">Incremental Development Alliance</a>
called the “Form Follows Finance” Fourplex:</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/form-follows-finance-fourplex.png" alt="Form Follows Finance Fourplex" /></p>

<p>This is a fourplex with 3 residential units and one commercial/office unit and
it has been specifically designed to meet ADA as well as mortgage requirements.
Yes, you can get a federally backed mortgage to buy/build this, because it
meets the criteria to be called a house. This allows it to be affordable for
smaller developers. More importantly, it’s less likely to catch flak from
neighbors, or at least less flak, due to it’s relatively small size.
It wouldn’t be out of place in any of the P-1 zones on the map above, or most
Lexington neighborhoods for that matter.</p>

<p>This goes to show how relatively small tweaks to our zoning code can open up a
ton of possibilities for better incremental development. Development that more
people can take part in, that adds more housing, and that is relatively
unobtrusive. If we want to see more of this kind of development, we have to 
update our zoning ordinance to allow them.</p>
