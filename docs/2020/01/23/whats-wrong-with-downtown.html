    <p>What do you think of when you think of “downtown” or “Main St” in a general
sense? For some, this brings images of Norman Rockwell paintings or, for
something more recent, Star’s Hollow, quaint and cozy. For others, it may be
taller buildings with more hustle and bustle. Either way, people typically think
of “downtown” or “Main St” as the heart and soul of the city or town. Usually
filled with a variety of shops, restaurants, and, most importantly, people. Now
think of downtown Lexington. Does it draw forth the same images? I doubt it. For
most Lexingtonians, downtown is a place to visit on occasion, usually for a game
or show at Rupp Arena, a nice dinner or drink, and maybe even a visit to the
farmer’s market. But this isn’t the nostalgic “day trip downtown”. It’s usually
in and out, with maybe one other stop. Why would you do anything differently?
downtown Lexington is, for all but a few exceptions, rather soulless. There’s no
reason to stroll the streets, little retail, and even if you wanted to, it’s
hardly a conducive environment for walking around. The reasons for this are
many, but can be summed up in two points; downtown Lexington has too few small
retail spaces and the majority of the pedestrian experience is terrible. Let’s
get into details along with how we can start to fix these problems.</p>

<p>Lexington has a rather different problem compared to other similar-sized
cities; where many cities suffer from disinvestment in their downtown core
resulting in vacant storefronts, Lexington doesn’t even have that many
storefronts to begin with. This lack of small retail space has many side
effects. First, this hampers small, growing retailers. Someone may have started
a small business in their basement or garage but once they outgrow that space,
they find their options limited. They most likely can’t immediately jump into a
larger retail space with the heavier rent they command, but the spaces they can
afford are spread throughout the city, usually in an older strip mall. This
immediately puts the shop at a disadvantage compared to a walkable location. The
shop’s discoverability is hurt as they are dependent on people already knowing
about them before visiting because people are significantly less likely to see
them and pull off the road on impulse. Compare this to a walkable cluster of
small shops and the business has a much larger chance of getting impulse
shoppers. The businesses benefit from each other’s customers due to proximity,
leading to people window shopping. You’re more likely to notice a small shop
when you walk by on the sidewalk than you are driving by &gt;30mph.</p>

<p>But why does downtown Lexington have so few shop spaces? Lexington used to have
them, along with the fine-grained urbanism that accompanies them. You can see it
in old photos and postcards, along with plenty of people milling about. Then
downtown saw massive redevelopment through the 70s and 80s. This is when the
massive office buildings went in. PNC Tower, Central Bank, the Hilton, and more
were all built between 1972 and 1987.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/downtown/central_bank.png" alt="Central Bank" /></p>

<p>These buildings with their massive
footprints, sometimes the majority of a block, wiped out the old narrow
storefronts. We saw this recently play out with City Center, aka Centerpointe;
an entire walkable block leveled and replaced with offices and hotels. What
little retail was redeveloped is too large for any small business that isn’t a
chain.</p>

<p>Also, all those big offices built parking, tons and tons of parking. Which led
to more fine-grained urbanism being torn down to replaced with blank expanses
of surface parking.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/downtown/parking_crater.png" alt="Parking Crater" /></p>

<p>Or “missing teeth” in our streetscapes.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/downtown/missing_tooth.png" alt="Missing Tooth" /></p>

<p>What’s almost worse than losing a bunch of existing, walkable retail space is
what replaced it. With all that redevelopment came two design decisions that
kill the street experience for pedestrians; mirrored windows and blank concrete
walls.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/downtown/chase.png" alt="Chase Bank" /></p>

<p>Whether it’s an office tower with the ground floor being 90% mirrored
glass or just vast expanses of blank concrete walls, it turns the building into
an uninteresting void. There’s nothing to look at and nothing that grabs your
attention as you walk by.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/downtown/bbt.png" alt="BB&amp;T" /></p>

<p>This is important because it takes very little to
dissuade someone from strolling around. You can see this today by watching the
areas that mostly dodged the redevelopment, Short St. and Tandy Park. When the
farmer’s market sets up in the pavilion you will see tons of people around, but
they don’t wander far. Why would they? There are only restaurants around Short
Street and even if you endeavored to cross the highway that is Main Street, all
you’d be greeted with is a soulless parking garage and the blank Big Blue
Building. Overall, our downtown is not built for strolling around. This isn’t to
say that office towers and hotels don’t belong downtown, they most certainly do.
But how they interact with the street has a massive impact on the feel of
downtown as a whole.</p>

<p>A walkable, and more importantly, livable downtown requires good street
experiences. This comes from having a variety of buildings and uses. Window
shopping requires windows, ones that you can see through. There
remain some good examples downtown, like The Clock Shop or the Pam Miller
Downtown Arts Center, but they are few and quite literally far between.</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/downtown/clockshop.png" alt="The Clock Shop" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/downtown/arts_center.png" alt="Arts Center" /></p>

<p>But you can also see it in one of the places that helped take investment away
from downtown, Fayette Mall.
Why do you think they chose to redevelop the large old Sears space
into a bunch of smaller spaces? That variety keeps you walking and wondering
what’s around the corner. All the shops have windows and displays to entice
people to enter. Now imagine the experience of shopping at a mall where there
maybe a couple of clusters of small shops but in between are just blank walls
and mirrored windows. That’s essentially what our downtown is, in addition to
the high-speed car traffic.</p>

<p>So how can we go about fixing this? As much as I’d love to tear down some of the
truly bland office towers, their massive size means it would be extremely
expensive to redevelop them. So I’d propose a simpler, cheaper, and more
incremental approach. We should see to redesigning and redeveloping just the
ground floors of the buildings, specifically to build smaller retail spaces.
The city can incentivize this sort of development with restrictions against
reflective ground floor windows (maybe even second floor) and putting caps on
ground floor unit square footage. This still requires buy-in from the property
owners but at the very least it will hopefully prevent any additional terrible
ground floors from being built.</p>

<p>Another thing that we can look at is the iconic Kentucky Theater</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/downtown/the_kentucky.png" alt="The Kentucky" /></p>

<p>A great local amenity, right in the heart of downtown. It’s the perfect “pull”
to bring people downtown. But what’s next door?</p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/downtown/townbranch_storefront.png" alt="Town Branch Storefront" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/downtown/payment_center.png" alt="Payment Center" /></p>

<p><img src="/assets/img/downtown/lextv.png" alt="LexTV" /></p>

<p>It’s surrounded by storefronts that have been converted into government offices
with blinds that are perpetually closed. The irony of advertising the pedestrian
and streetscape improvements happening one street over while contributing to the
lack of activity on Main St. is something else. This could be a huge opportunity
for the government to convert these places back to storefronts and rent them
out. Give the government some revenue and contribute to a more vibrant Main St.</p>

<p>We are also grossly overparked. A tremendous amount of space is wasted for car
storage during the day, which is then empty at night. We should look into
policies that can dissuade surface parking lots and encourage better use of the
land.</p>

<p>If we want a truly walkable and livable
downtown, we have to make sure that the built environment is conducive to that.
Having shops spread out with nothing but parking, blank walls, and
mirrored glass between them leads to a soulless downtown.
We need to ensure that we have buildings that contribute to downtown and don’t
turn their back to the street. We need to ensure that we have spaces for
the small shops and businesses that make a street lively and vibrant. We need to
make downtown a place where people want to live and linger, not just drive
through.</p>
